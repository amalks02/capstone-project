        "The Airbnb EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project involved analyzing a dataset containing information about Airbnb listings, including various attributes such as location, property type, price, availability, and guest reviews. The goal of the project was to gain insights into the data and provide recommendations to help Airbnb achieve its business objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a summary of the key steps and findings from the Airbnb EDA project:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Data Collection: The project started with collecting the Airbnb dataset, which contained information about listings, hosts, and guests. The dataset included features such as listing price, property type, neighborhood, availability, and guest reviews.\n",
        "* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: This data set contains null values and 0 values in the columns and also some outliers in the continuous variables.\n",
        "Removed 3 columns names id,name and last review because these columns doesn't have not much influence on the analysis process of the dataset.Reviews per month column contains null values we just replaced it with 0 .\n",
        "* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The main focus of the project was on EDA, which involved analyzing the dataset to gain insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings and guest behavior. This included visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships, distributions, and trends in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following plots are used to evaluate the data\n",
        "* Private rooms are preffered over other rooms- This is analyzed using bar plots.Bar plot is created using sum of the reviews per month in y-axis and room type in x-axis.\n",
        "* Which neighbourhood is generating more revenue wrt room type-We used a stacked bar chart here.In the x-axis we use different neighbourhood groups and in the y-axis used total money for the room types.\n",
        "* Which neighbourhood is mostly preffered wrt reviews per month-Here we used a pie chart to show the percentage owned by the neighbourhoods.\n",
        "* Distribution of availability of room vs neighbourhood group-It is visualized using boxplot.We can see the distribution of avalibilty of rooms in different neighbourhoods using this plot,also it shows the minimum,maximum and mean values also.\n",
        "* Checking correlation between variables-Analyzed correlation between some features using heatmap.\n",
        "* Top 10 busiest hosts wrt reviews per month-Create a bar chart showing that the top 10 busiest hosts with respect to reviews per month,and find the most busiest host.\n",
        "* Price vs minimum nights-Plot a scatter plot of price vs minimum night to understand the spread of the data and plot box plots for price and minimum nights to understand the distribution of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Insights: Through EDA, several key insights were uncovered, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "Distribution of listing prices across different neighborhoods and property types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlations between listing attributes such as price, minimum nights, and availability.\n",
        "Impact of guest reviews and ratings on listing performance and occupancy rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommendations: Based on the insights gained from the EDA, recommendations were provided to Airbnb to help achieve its business objectives. These recommendations included optimizing pricing strategies, improving listing performance, enhancing customer experience, targeting marketing efforts, and expanding inventory and market reach.\n",

        "###conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Manhttan being the urban core of New York city, many people across US come to live a descent lifestyle. It has many globally recognised tourist attractions, thus people from around the globe flock into this city. It is also the most expensive places among other neighbourhoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Brooklyn is both residential and industrial hotspot. Many people around the country and globe comes here in search of employment. It is the second most expensive neighbourhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sonder(NYC), Blueground, Michael and David are top 4 most spending customers. Their popular destinations is mainly Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.\n",
        "\n",
        "To start a business associated to Airbnb, one should acquire an Entire home/apt in Williamsburg neighbourhood. As, we saw Williamsburg accounts for nearly 8% of the total listings in entire NY city, it implies most days of the year rooms will be booked. And as average price of Entire home/apt is much higher, it might provide high return on investment."
